# Image Upload and Gallery server

This must be up and running in order for the image uploader and gallery to work properly.

To run this server you need a couple of environment variables:

- AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME - which is the name of your azure storage account
- AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_KEY - which is the access key to the storage account which can be found in the Azure portal
